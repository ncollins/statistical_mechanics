Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations
==================================================

I'm working through the École normale supérieure's 
[Statistical Mechanics](https://class.coursera.org/smac-001) on Coursera.
The class uses Python but I thought it would be a good oportunity to
brush up on my Julia knowledge.
